            Hi! Thanks for visiting my website. 
            </h3>
            <p>
            My name is Ben Tagtow and I'm a developer from Denver, Colorado. 
            </p>
            <p>
            My background is in marketing & communications, which was my career until last year. 
            However, a chance-encounter with a neighbor last summer who happened to be a software engineer
            led all of that to change. 
            </p>
            <p>
            After discovering the possibilities (along with awesome challenges) of software development, 
            I realized I had been missing an important sense of fulfillment in my life and I needed to pursue it. 
            </p>
            <p className="emphasis">
            The opportunity to change the world through technology has never been more potent. 
            </p>
            <p>
            
            That's why, in 2019, I quit my job and 
            headed to coding school. And I've never looked back since. 
            </p>
            
            <p>

            If you'd like to get to know me, you can find my professional history 
            and a little insight into my life using the menu on the left-hand side.
